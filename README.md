# Sample-to-Song
## Background
I used the music programming language ChucK and a single audio sample of myself playing trombone to create a computerized audio playback of Vienna Teng's composition **"The Hymn of Acxiom"**. This project showcases the ability of a music programming language to create a musically complex audio output with volume, note length, and pitch controls stemming from a single sample note.

**Final Output:** https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e7828cf-0fa1-48e4-a99c-52371a34edbe

**Sheet Music Reference:** [Hymn_of_Acxiom-Score_and_Parts.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22237740/Hymn_of_Acxiom-Score_and_Parts.pdf)

I highly recommend you check out the inspiration for this work ->
